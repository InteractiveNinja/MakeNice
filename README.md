## Problems with Installing the Modules?

There are two Files you can use:
* [Install Modules.bat](https://github.com/InteractiveNinja/MakeNice/blob/master/Install%20Modules.bat)
* [Install Modules with Proxy.bat](https://github.com/InteractiveNinja/MakeNice/blob/master/Install%20Modules%20with%20Proxy.bat)

~~Common its not that hard~~
